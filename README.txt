To start the game you will need to have a few things installed.  

1. Python.  	Developed using Python 2.5.1 from http://python.org/
2. Python-ogre.  This is available for a variety of platforms from 
     http://python-ogre.org/  We tested it under Windows and Linux
     successfully.

Under windows if you have these prerequisists installed, you should 
be able to double-click on GlobOfMusic.py and have the game start 
up.  

Ogre will propmt you for various graphics settings.  We found 
that 1024x786 gave acceptable perfomance, but Moore's law suggests 
that higher options will be available if anyone eventually reads this.

If you are running this under Linux, you should already know how 
to run a python script.  If not, it's well worth your time to 
look into it.


Keybindings:
WASD: player motion
IJKL: camera motion
Spacebar: Jump
VC: Powerup (once aquired)

It also should work with a joystick.  We liked using the Xbox controller.

Enjoy!
